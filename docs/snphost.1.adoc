NAME
----
snphost - Command line tool for managing the AMD SEV-SNP environment.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*snphost* [GLOBAL_OPTIONS] [_COMMAND_] [_COMMAND_ARGS_] +
*snphost* [_-h, --help_] +
*snphost* *command* *--help*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
snphost is a CLI utility for managing and interacting with the AMD SEV-SNP
firmware device of a host system.


GLOBAL OPTIONS
--------------
*-q, --quiet*:: Don't print any output to the console.


COMMANDS
--------
*snphost export*::
        usage: snphost export [der, pem] CERT-FILE DIR-PATH

        This command exports the SEV-SNP certificate chain to the directory
        provided by DIR-PATH. User has to provide the CERT-FILE where the certs
        are currently stored in (in GHCB format). The user must also specify if 
        they want the certs to be exported in PEM or DER certificate format. These are the only
        two encoding formats supported in this tool. Currently only AMD chain certificates (ARK, ASK, VCEK and VLEK)
        are supported for export.

  options:
        -h, --help      Show a help message.

*snphost import*::
	usage: snphost import DIR-PATH CERT-FILE

        This command imports serialized SEV-SNP certificates to the specified CERT-FILE.
        This CERT-FILE can then be provided to QEMU to perform extended attestation on guest.
        Currently, only the ASK, ARK, VCEK and VLEK are supported to serialize in the tool. 
        Note that there are a few user requirements for this command to work as intended.

        All certificates must be located in the same directory with specific
        names:
                ARK certificate => ark.{pem, der}
                ASK certificate => ask.{pem, der}
                VCEK certificate => vcek.{pem, der}
                VLEK certificate => vlek.{pem, der}

        Not all certificates are needed in the directory, only the ones that a
        user is looking to import to the CERT-FILE.

  options:
        -h, --help      Show a help message

*snphost ok*::
	usage: snphost ok

        This command probes the processor, sysfs, and KVM for AMD SEV-SNP
        related capabilities on the host and emits the results.

 options:
    -h, --help          Show a help message

*snphost commit*::
	usage: snphost commit

        This command commits the current firmware and SNP platform config versions to the PSP.
        This can't be undone and will not allow rollbacks to older versions.

  options:
        -h, --help      Show a help message.

*snphost config set*::
	usage: snphost config set BOOTLOADER TEE SNP-FW MICROCODE MASK-CHIP

        This command allows the user to change the config of the SNP platform. The user can
        provide the desired versions of the different TCB paramerters they would like to modify.
        The command will change the reported values by the PSP. In order to have this changes commited, the 
        user would have to use snphost commit. The user can also provide a new mask-chip value that 
        will change the mask chip bit field values in the config.

        Explanation of the different parmeters:
        BOOTLOADER: Desired reported bootloader version
        TEE: Desired reported PSP OS version
        SNP-FW: Desired reported SNP Firmware level
        MICROCODE: Desired reported patch level of all the cores
        MASK-CHIP: Change the CHIP ID and CHIP KEY settings by changing the MASK-CHIP bits.
                   Valid values range from 0-3 depending on what bits the user wants enabled.

                   Bit[0] -> CHIP ID: Indicates that the CHIP_ID field in the attestation report
                                      will always be 0.
                   Bit[1] -> MASK KEY: Indicates that the VCEK is not used in attestation and guest
                                       key derivation.

                   For example, if the user would like MASK KEY to be enabled and CHIP ID disabled, 
                   then the they would pass in a 2.
	FMC: Current FMC firmware version

  options:
        -h, --help      Show a help message.

*snphost config reset*::
	usage: snphost config reset

        This command resets the SEV-SNP platform. This will clear all
        persistent data managed by the platform and reset the platform configuration
        to its last committed version.

  options:
        -h, --help      Show a help message.

*snphost show*::
        usage: snphost show [guests, identifier, tcb, vcek-url, version ]

        This command describes the state of the SEV-SNP platform. There are
        several platform details to describe:

        Guest count:            snphost show guests
        Platform identifier:    snphost show identifier
        TCB version:            snphost show tcb
        VCEK URL:               snphost show vcek-url
        Firmware version:       snphost show version

 options:
    -h, --help          Show a help message

*snphost verify*::
	usage: snphost verify DIR-PATH

        This command verifies the full SEV-SNP/CA certificate chain.
        It will use the ask,ark, and vek (vcek or vlek) certificates that are
        stored in the provided directory. If both the vlek and vcek are present,
        then the tool will use the vlek by default.

 options:
    -h, --help          Show a help message

*snphost fetch ca*::
	usage: snphost fetch ca [ der, pem ] DIR-PATH

        This command fetches the host system's CA certificate chain and writes
        the encoded certificates to the directory at path DIR-PATH. Users must
        specify which format they would like the certificate to be encoded
        in (DER or PEM).

 options:
    -h, --help          Show a help message

*snphost fetch vcek*::
	usage: snphost fetch vcek [ der, pem ] DIR-PATH [url]

        This command fetches the host system's versioned chip endorsement
        key (VCEK) and writes the encoded certificate to the directory at path
        DIR-PATH. Users must specify which format they would like the
        certificate to be encoded in (DER or PEM). The URL of the VCEK can be
        explicitly set. If not explicitly set, the URL will be generated based
        on firmware data.

 options:
    -h, --help          Show a help message

*snphost fetch crl*::
	usage: snphost fetch crl DIR-PATH

        This command fetches the host system's certificate revokation list
        (CRL) and writes the encoded list to the directory at path DIR-PATH.

 options:
    -h, --help          Show a help message
