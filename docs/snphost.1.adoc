NAME
----
snphost - Command line tool for managing the AMD SEV-SNP environment.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*snphost* [GLOBAL_OPTIONS] [_COMMAND_] [_COMMAND_ARGS_] +
*snphost* [_-h, --help_] +
*snphost* *command* *--help*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
snphost is a CLI utility for managing and interacting with the AMD SEV-SNP
firmware device of a host system.


GLOBAL OPTIONS
--------------
*-q, --quiet*:: Don't print any output to the console.


COMMANDS
--------
*snphost export*::
        usage: snphost export [der, pem] DIR-PATH

        This command exports the SEV-SNP certificate chain to the directory
        provided by DIR-PATH. User must specify if the certificates currently
        stored on the PSP are encoded in DER or PEM format. These are the only
        two encoding formats supported in this tool.

  options:
        -h, --help      Show a help message.

*snphost import*::
	usage: snphost import DIR-PATH

        This command imports serialized SEV-SNP certificates to the host's PSP.
        Currently, only the ASK, ARK, and VCEK are able to be imported to the
        PSP. Note that there are a few user requirements for this command to
        work as intended.

        All certificates must be located in the same directory with specific
        names:
                ARK certificate => ark.{pem, der}
                ASK certificate => ask.{pem, der}
                VCEK certificate => vcek.{pem, der}

        Not all certificates are needed in the directory, only the ones that a
        user is looking to import to the PSP.

  options:
        -h, --help      Show a help message

*snphost ok*::
	usage: snphost ok

        This command probes the processor, sysfs, and KVM for AMD SEV-SNP
        related capabilities on the host and emits the results.

 options:
    -h, --help          Show a help message

*snphost reset*::
	usage: snphost reset

        This command resets the SEV-SNP platform. This will clear all
        persistent data managed by the platform.

  options:
        -h, --help      Show a help message.

*snphost show*::
        usage: snphost show [guests, identifier, tcb, vcek-url, version ]

        This command describes the state of the SEV-SNP platform. There are
        several platform details to describe:

        Guest count:            snphost show guests
        Platform identifier:    snphost show identifier
        TCB version:            snphost show tcb
        VCEK URL:               snphost show vcek-url
        Firmware version:       snphost show version

 options:
    -h, --help          Show a help message

*snphost verify*::
	usage: snphost verify ARK-PATH ASK-PATH VCEK-PATH

        This command verifies the full SEV-SNP/CA certificate chain.
        Certificates must be encoded in PEM format.

 options:
    -h, --help          Show a help message

*snphost fetch ca*::
	usage: snphost fetch ca [ der, pem ] DIR-PATH

        This command fetches the host system's certificate chain and writes
        the encoded certificates to the directory at path DIR-PATH. Users must
        specify which format they would like the certificate to be encoded
        in (DER or PEM).

 options:
    -h, --help          Show a help message

*snphost fetch vcek*::
	usage: snphost fetch vcek [ der, pem ] DIR-PATH

        This command fetches the host system's versioned chip endorsement
        key (VCEK) and writes the encoded certificate to the directory at path
        DIR-PATH. Users must specify which format they would like the
        certificate to be encoded in (DER or PEM).

 options:
    -h, --help          Show a help message

*snphost fetch crl*::
	usage: snphost fetch crl DIR-PATH

        This command fetches the host system's certificate revokation list
        (CRL) and writes the encoded list to the directory at path DIR-PATH.

 options:
    -h, --help          Show a help message
